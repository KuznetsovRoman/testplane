# RUNNER_END {#runner-end}

**async | master**

The `RUNNER_END` event is triggered after the test is executed and before all workers are finished. The event handler can be asynchronous: in this case, all workers will be finished only after the _Promise_ returned by the event handler is resolved.

## Subscription {#subscription}

```javascript
testplane.on(testplane.events.RUNNER_END, async (result) => {
    console.info('Processing the RUNNER_END eventâ€¦');
});
```

### Handler parameters {#handler-parameters}

An object with test run statistics of the following type is passed to the event handler:

```typescript
{
    passed: number
    failed: number
    retries: number
    skipped: number
    total: number
}
```

## Usage {#usage}

See the example in [above](./runner-start.md#usage) about opening and closing a tunnel when starting and stopping the runner.
